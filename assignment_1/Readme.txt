run_batch - modified batch file for job submission to stampede

Please change the nthreads value to match the number of elements in the array.I modified the batch file(run_batch) to accept 2 command line arg( after output put $1 $2), so the batch file needs to be run as eg â€“ sbatch run_batch file_450.txt 450  ( 450 is the number records in the file and file_450.txt is the file name)
